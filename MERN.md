## MERN

**M**ongo DB - (Database Solution NoSQL)
 **E**xpress.js - (Node framework)
 **R**eact.js - (Browser-side JS Library)
 **N**ode.js - (Server-side JavaScript Runtime)

So, ***React*** is going to build the front-end and it will also communicate with the back-end. ***Node.JS*** is going to help us build the server, so we can manipulate, receive and send data from the Database to our Web App. ***Express*** Was created to use Node, but it allows you to write simplified code and logic. At last, we are going to use ***Mongo DB*** to build our NoSQL Database.
